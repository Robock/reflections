When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository is used when you want to share your project with other people 
or when you want to push your commits from one device to another through GitHub.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually instead of Git automatically update remote repository allows 
users to make sure nothing they don't want to share yet is pulled to a remote repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another? 

The difference between forks, clones and branches is: when you fork, you're making a copy 
of the repository and any changes you make to the forked file would not be reflected in 
the original file. If you clone a repository, make changes to it, commit and push, if the 
original file owner wants to accept your push, it will chane the original file. Branching is
a little different from the above two because braching creates a separate branch from the
master in which you can make changes and commit.
