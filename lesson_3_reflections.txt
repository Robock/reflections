When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository is used when you want to share your project with other people 
or when you want to push your commits from one device to another through GitHub.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually instead of Git automatically update remote repository allows 
users to make sure nothing they don't want to share yet is pulled to a remote repository.
